# Bitcoin Powerday 2023 (Teasure Hunt)

Everybody heard of Bitcoin,
but only few people understand why it works
and even fewer understand how it works exactly.

The "why" is best described in the original Satoshi paper
(execute `open /System/Library/Image\ Capture/Devices/VirtualScanner.app/Contents/Resources/simpledoc.pdf` on your Macbook).

The "how" is a bit more complex and involves the term "programmable money".
Bitcoin has its own stack language (remember [Forth](https://skilldrick.github.io/easyforth/)
from the [Learning Week 2018](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cbnBvq3aTNqF0G6TLURtrfP20-L-in0p-7Oaq-_F3-k/edit#slide=id.g44204a8dda_0_0)?)
It can be used to write "scripts" or smart contracts
(yes, exactly the thing you might think would be the [innovation of Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/)).
During the day we'll look at how this scripts work and we'll try to dig up some lost coins.

### Motivation

The Bitcoin Lightning Network becomes more widely used and
it becomes as easy and as cheap as never before to send money to humans or even machines.
Lightning "zaps" are for example part of [_nostr_](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/57.md)
where you can now use micro-cent transactions instead of "likes".
What Facebook wanted to do with [_Libra_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diem_(digital_currency))
is basically already existing and working.

### Preparation

If you don't feel comfortable around the terms proof-of-work, hashes, public-key-cryptography,
then please read-up as preparation. _3blue1brown_ is a good source (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4).
If you like to read code, there's simplified bitcoin-like blockchain here: https://github.com/renuo/lapidar/tree/master/lib/lapidar
(relevant classes: `Block`, `Chain`, `Miner`, `Assessment`).

## The Day

In the morning we'll try to understand how the shovel works.
In the afternoon we'll use it to dig.

### Our Full Node

We've got a potent root server today (12 CPUs, 128GB RAM, 3TB SSD)
on which runs a Bitcoin full synching node.
This means that all transactions ever made are on this server and
especially important is that all unspent transactions (UTXO) are in memory.

You can ssh with the password on 1Password.
We share all the same user (root), so be responsible.

```
ssh root@116.202.233.206
```

The full node consists of the following two commands:
- Bitcoin Daemon (running, please don't stop it).
  This is the full node accepting and digesting transactions
- Bitcoin CLI
 It can be used to interact with the daemon.

```
ll ~/bin
```

Bitcoin Core was installed via _snap_.
The main folder holds the configuration and the blockchain.

```
ll ~/snap/bitcoin-core/common/.bitcoin
tail -f ~/snap/bitcoin-core/common/.bitcoin/debug.log
```

The CLI can be used to query the daemon
(e.g. for the time-lock transaction of Amina).

```
bitcoin-cli getblockchaininfo
bitcoin-cli getrawtransaction 7b54b80435abf38ef91e479411c94b6b1dc0e7962cd4d870ec425658127c307b
```

For programming we don't use `bitcoin-cli` but JSON-RPC
(e.g. to retrieve the first block ever mined and have a look at it's coinbase text).

```
bitcoin-cli getblockhash 0
result=$(curl --silent \
     --user renuo:powerday \
     --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id": "curltest", "method": "getblock", "params": ["000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f", 2]}' \
     -H 'content-type: text/plain;' \
     http://127.0.0.1:8332/)
echo $result

# Extract field and convert hex to ASCII.
echo $result | jq '.result.tx[0].vin[0].coinbase' | xxd -r -p && echo ''
```

**Attention:**
No connections from the outside are accepted.
If you want to, please setup an SSH tunnel.

### This Repository

We'll collect and share our code here. Feel free to also use the Wiki.
You can check out this repo on the server.
It's probably best if you work in a separate folder on a separate branch.
Maybe someone can get [my trial for auto-deployment](.github/workflows/deploy.yml) to work.

```
cd ~/powerday/
git clone git@github.com:renuo/bitcoin-powerday-2023.git "<YOURNAME>"
cd <YOURNAME>
git checkout -b <YOURNAME>
```

### Bitcoin Script

Bitcoin transactions actually consist of puzzles anyone can solve if they provide the correct program.
Its programs are written in a Forth-like stack programming language which look like this:

```
10 5 5 OP_ADD OP_EQUAL
```

This program is split into two parts:

* Locking script (scriptPubKey) in the funding transaction's output

  ```
  5 5 OP_ADD OP_EQUAL
  ```
* Unlocking script (scriptSig) in the spending transaction's input
  
  ```
  10
  ```

So whoever can provide a valid solution to the locking script can spend
the funds. There may be multiple solutions (e.g. `7 3 OP_ADD`).

Most Bitcoin transaction scripts look like this:

```
<signature> <publikKey> OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <publicKeyHash> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG
```

Question: Can you tell which part is in the funding transaction output 
and which is in the spending transaction input?

### Treasure Hunt (afternoon)

Since anyone providing the correct unlocking script can spend the funding transaction's output
it seems attractive to search for such puzzles to solve. This what we want to try this
afternoon.

There are some idea on what we could try:
* Exploit bugs in software:
  * snipe empty script transactions, see https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5261766.0
    and https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/addresses/btc/3J98t1WpEZ73CNmQviecrnyiWrnqRhWNLy
  * search for private keys (starting with a specific number)
* Social engineering for P2SH to replay or alter examples from 
  * Books
  * GitHub issues
  * Forums
  * Random numbers or seeds, like `1` in coinb.in resulting in the address https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/addresses/btc/1Dt8ty59tU9LkrXG2ocWeSzKFAY8fu6jga`
  * Nice private keys, like `11111…`
  * Own ideas, like how you would play around with a timelock (`506321 OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY OP_DROP`)
* your own ideas…
